<h2>
Issue Summary
</h2>
<p>Duration of Outage: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on January 15, 2024.</p>

Impact: Our web application, the heart of our digital ecosystem,
was down for a bit. Users reported difficulty loading pages,
with approximately 60% of users experiencing these issues.
It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but with more frustration.

Root Cause: The root cause was a memory leak in our application's backend,
specifically within a caching mechanism that was not properly releasing memory.
It was like a party where the guests kept bringing more snacks without clearing the old ones, leading to a chaotic mess.

<h3>Timeline</h3>
10:00 AM: The issue was first detected by our monitoring system, which alerted us to an unusual spike in memory usage.
10:15 AM: An engineer confirmed the alert and began investigating the issue.
10:30 AM: The engineer identified the caching mechanism as the potential source of the memory leak.
11:00 AM: The issue was escalated to the backend development team for further investigation.
11:30 AM: The backend development team confirmed the memory leak and began working on a fix.
12:00 PM: A temporary fix was implemented to mitigate the issue.
12:30 PM: The permanent fix was deployed, and the issue was fully resolved.


<h3>Root Cause and Resolution</h3>
Root Cause: The memory leak was caused by a caching mechanism that was not properly releasing memory. 
It was like a magician's trick gone wrong, where the assistant keeps multiplying instead of disappearing.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by implementing a memory management strategy that ensures the caching mechanism releases memory back to the system when it is no longer in use. 
It was like the magician's assistant finally disappearing, leaving the audience in awe.


<h3>Corrective and Preventative Measures</h3>
<h5>Improvements:</h5>

Implement stricter memory management practices across all components of the application.
Enhance monitoring to detect memory leaks more quickly.
Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential memory leaks before they become critical issues.


<h5>Tasks to Address the Issue:</h5>

Review and update the caching mechanism to include a more robust garbage collection routine.
Implement additional monitoring checks for memory usage and leaks.
Conduct a comprehensive code review of the application to identify and address potential memory leaks.
Establish a regular schedule for code reviews and performance audits.
Train the development team on best practices for memory management to prevent future issues.


<h4>
This postmortem outlines the steps taken to identify,
resolve, and prevent future memory leaks in our web application. 
By addressing the root cause and implementing corrective and preventative measures, 
we aim to enhance the stability and performance of our service.</h4>
